<h3>How to train your dragon</h3>
<p>Kids will learn a bit about Vikings and mythology. Parents need to know that How to Train Your Dragon is an excellent book-based adventure comedy about a clever young Viking that includes some fantasy violence and potentially frightening images of dragons which could scare some young movie-goers</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets.</p>
<h3>No Way Home</h3>
<p>Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks.
